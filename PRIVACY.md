# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

Catchpoint is an offline-first fishing log application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

## Data Collection

### Data Stored Locally

All your fishing data is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB:

- Catch records (species, weight, length, notes, photos)
- Location coordinates (GPS)
- Weather data
- Your preferences (theme, units, language)

**This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.**

### Third-Party Services

#### OpenWeatherMap

- When online, we fetch current weather data for your catch location
- Only your GPS coordinates are sent to OpenWeatherMap
- See their privacy policy: https://openweathermap.org/privacy-policy

#### Mapbox

- We use Mapbox for map display and location visualization
- Your location is used to display the map and your catch markers
- See their privacy policy: https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy

## Data You Control

- **Export**: You can export all your data as CSV anytime
- **Delete**: You can delete all data from Settings
- **Offline**: The app works fully offline - no data is transmitted

## No Tracking

We do not:

- Track your usage or behavior
- Use analytics services
- Collect personal information
- Share your data with third parties (except as noted above for map/weather functionality)
